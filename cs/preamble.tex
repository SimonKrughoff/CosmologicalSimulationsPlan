This is a report from the Cosmological Simulations Working Group (CS WG) on the simulation plan for the data challenges as defined in the Science Roadmap (SRM). The report summarizes the simulation plan, computing needs, and personnel resources required to enable the delivery of the data challenge products as outlined in the SRM.

\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:preamble:introduction}

In this report we provide the following information regarding the plans for the Cosmological Simulations WG:

\begin{itemize}
   \item    an overview of the key simulations, based on the SRM (key characteristics and delivery timescale) for DC1, 2, and 3, focusing on
     \begin{itemize}
        \item        simulation generation (gravity-only and hydrodynamics)
        \item        catalog development, including testing and validation
        \item        infrastructure to handle, manipulate, and distribute simulations
     \end{itemize}
   \item    an estimate of the resources needed to meet the given timelines (indicating which are secured and which are yet to be secured)
     \begin{itemize}
        %\item        current simulations/catalogs that are to be used in the near term COVERED IN SECTION 2 ALREADY
        \item        HPC resources needed for simulation generation (those in place and those to be secured)
        \item        Personnel effort for simulation, catalog and infrastructure development and testing work
        \item        Names of those who are responsible for delivering each major simulation deliverable (definiteness key for FY17 and FY18 and then can be more fluid in FY19).
     \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
